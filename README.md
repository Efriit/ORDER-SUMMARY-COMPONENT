## Overview

As you can see, i completed the challenge, but that doesn't mean that it's ok, but i've done my best.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

First, i wrapped all the content (except the attribution) in a main container, and with the property flex and others i did a box in the center of the screen with all the content. Later, step by step fill all the box with the content. And Voilá! the challenge is finished.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

More than learn something, I think i improve my skills with CSS and HTML a bit more, but if someone see something wrong in the code or something improvable, please tell me for improve my skills and thank you.
